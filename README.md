# Image-transformation

This repository consists of documentation of some image transformation implementation
1. Methods to obtain bird eye view for small scale embedded devices.pdf is a paper that discusses four different methods that can be applied to obtain a BEV, using openCV and openMV for raspberry pi and arduino devices.
2. On Homography transformation and lane detection.pdf discusses the process and results of bird eye view transformation. This includes:
  * monocular amera calibration
  * Stereo camera calibration
  * Bird eye view and lane detection
  * Stereo camera approach to improve lane detection (Work in Progress).
